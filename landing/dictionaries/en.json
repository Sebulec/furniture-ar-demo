    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about integrating AR into your store.",
    "q1": "Do I need a 3D scanner to use SpaceCheck?",
    "a1": "No. SpaceCheck uses advanced AI to generate 3D models from standard 2D product photos. You just need a clear image of your furniture piece.",
    "q2": "Does it work on iPhone and Android?",
    "a2": "Yes. We automatically convert models to USDZ (for iOS QuickLook) and GLB (for Android SceneViewer) to ensure native compatibility on all modern smartphones without requiring an app download.",
    "q3": "How do I add this to my online store?",
    "a3": "It's as simple as embedding a YouTube video. We provide a short HTML code snippet that you copy and paste into your product page template. It works with Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento, and custom sites.",
    "q4": "What happens if the AI model isn't perfect?",
    "a4": "Our AI is retrained specifically on furniture datasets for high accuracy. However, you can also manually upload your own 3D files if you already have them, using our viewer for the hosting and AR experience.",
    "q5": "Is there a limit to how many people can view the models?",
    "a5": "Our Starter plan includes generous bandwidth limits suitable for small stores. Enterprise plans offer unlimited views and global CDN caching for high-traffic retailers."
